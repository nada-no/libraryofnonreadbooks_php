# LEMP server for php development

This is a template for any php development needs

## Set up
``docker-compose up`` in the .yml folder.

To see the nginx files go to ``127.0.0.1`` not localhost. Files need to be placed in /app/public.

## PHPMyAdmin
To enter in the graphic interface of the database go to [http://127.0.0.1:8081](http://127.0.0.1:8081) and enter server: mysql, user: nada and password: secret.
